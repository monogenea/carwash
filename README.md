# Hackathon Retail 4.0 - Car Wash Challenge

This was meant to be a project about recommending a wash program for cars imaged in various different conditions. Meanwhile I dropped it since no data was provided, so this project went only as far as deploying a PaddleSeg model to extract car components from these images. I thought about using morphological operations with few images but the variation in angle, lighting, background, resolution and much more proved to be too restrictive. Probably a good training dataset would be needed to classify or quantify the amount of dirt in the vehicles.
